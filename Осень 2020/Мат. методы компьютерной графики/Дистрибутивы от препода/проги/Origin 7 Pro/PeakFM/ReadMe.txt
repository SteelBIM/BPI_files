Peak Fitting Module 7.0

----------

Before installing this version of the Peak Fitting Module (PFM), review the following information:

1)  If you are upgrading your Origin/PFM software and you selected to upgrade your existing copy of Origin (as opposed to installing Origin 7 into a new folder, leaving the existing copy of Origin unaltered), then you must uninstall your previous version of the PFM before installing the new PFM.  If you installed Origin 7 into a new folder (whether or not you transferred your old settings), then you can directly install the new PFM into this folder. 

2)  This version of the PFM checks that your Origin software is registered.  If it is not registered, the PFM will not install.  To check if your software is registered, start Origin and then select Help:About Origin.  If your software is registered, a Registration ID displays in the About Origin dialog box (bottom).  If the Registration ID field is blank, click the OK button to close this dialog box and then select Help:Register Online.  Click the Continue button in the OriginLab Registration dialog box.  This action opens the Registration dialog box.  Select the Register Now radio button and then click the "Click here to Register on-line and receive your Registration ID" button.  Follow the instructions on the OriginLab website to complete the registration process.  

----------

To uninstall a previous version of the PFM, perform the following operations:  

1)  Start Origin.  (If Origin is already open and if you have run the Peak Fitting wizard in the current Origin session, close Origin and then restart Origin.  If Origin is open and you have not run the wizard in the current session, proceed to the next step.) 

2)  Select View:Toolbars.  This opens the Customize Toolbar dialog box.

3)  On the Toolbars tab, select the PFM entry from the Toolbars list box.  (You can click on the text or in the check box.)  

4)  Click the Delete button.  This action removes the PFM from the Toolbars list.

5)  Select the Button Groups tab.  

6)  Select PFM from the Groups list box.  

7)  Click the Delete button in the Button Group group.  

8)  Click the Yes button in the Button Group attention box.  

9)  Close the Customize Toolbar dialog box.

To install this version of the PFM, perform the following:  

1)  Start Origin 7.  

2)  Select Tools:Pack/Unpack OPK Files.  This opens the Origin Pack dialog box.  

3)  Click the Open button in this dialog box and then browse and select the PFM.OPK file in the Origin Pack Files dialog box.  

4)  Click Open.  The Origin Pack dialog box then unpacks and lists the PFM files.  

During the PFM.OPK installation, a PFM button group is added to the Groups list box on the Button Groups tab of the Customize Toolbar dialog box (View:Toolbars).  Additionally, the PFM toolbar displays in the Origin workspace.  This toolbar includes one button, the Enter Peak Fitting Session button.  

----------

To enter a peak fitting session, perform the following:

You can enter a peak fitting session when either a worksheet or graph is active.  To enter a peak fitting session, click the Enter Peak Fitting Session button on the PFM toolbar.  This button opens the Peak Fitting wizard with the active dataset displaying in the wizard graph.  
Important Note:  When the Peak Fitting wizard is open, you should not activate and begin performing operations in Origin.  If you must return to Origin to perform operations, you should first close the Peak Fitting wizard.
